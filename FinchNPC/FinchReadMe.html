<H3><A name="INTRO">Introduction</A></H3>
<P>When the Iron Tutu competition rolled around in February of 2005, I knew that I lacked the familiarity with BG1 that would hold up against the time constraints of the event, but I had the will to do something Tutuesque to celebrate the theme of the weekend. That weekend turned into a month, resulting in this little endeavor, and is still undergoing various tweaks to improve and fill out the character.</P>

<P>This mod includes:</P>

<P><UL>
<LI>One neutral good, gnome cleric of Deneir</LI>
<LI>One NPC-related quest</LI>
<LI>One new soundset of dubious entertainment value</LI>
<LI>2-4 banters with each of the Bioware NPCs </LI>
<LI>Dozens and dozens of interjections</LI>
<LI>Banter with Indira and Mur'Neth custom NPCs, if installed</LI>
<LI>Some PC-init talks</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Finch is first found in Candlekeep ([1571.1942]), where she has been studying recently. The player can choose to talk to her during the prologue, or wait. You can encounter her again later down the road, regardless of whether you talk to her in Candlekeep.</P>

<H3><A name="RAR">To Play Finch NPC - Instructions for RAR install:</A></H3>
<OL>
	<LI>Extract the contents of FinchNPCv3.rar into the Tutu directory on your computer. (WinRAR is recommended. WinAce is known for poorly extracting mod files, causing woe to the poor players using it.)</LI>
	<LI>Double-click Setup-FinchNPC.exe. A console window (DOS window) opens up and asks you to choose a language option. 0 = English, 1 = French, 2 = Spanish, 3 = German. Type your number choice and enter.</LI>
	<LI>You will be prompted whether or not you wish to install Finch. Answer Yes.</LI>
	<LI>You'll see a list of files being copied, and scripts and dialogue being compiled. This process may take a minute or two on a slower system.</LI>
	<LI>After the text window tells you to press enter to exit, there is one final stage--decompressing the compressed audio included with Finch to the standard WAV format. The window will fill with text: THIS IS NORMAL. This process may take a few minutes on a slower system.</LI>
	<LI>Start a new game and enjoy! (You should be able to use a game in progress, too.)</LI>
</OL>

<P>If anything goes wrong with the process, or you later wish to uninstall Finch, run the Setup-FinchNPC.exe program once more and select the U option.</P>

<P>Finch should be highly compatible with virtually any other Tutu mod out there. I have played her with these Tutu mods installed without making any puppies cry:</P>

<P>BG1NPC
<BR>Mur'Neth
<BR>Indira
<BR>Sirine's Call
<BR>Song and Silence
<BR>TutuTweaks
</P>
<P>Finch was created using these fine tools:</P>

<P>WeiDU
<BR>Near Infinity
<BR>DLTCEP
<BR>Shadow Keeper
<BR>BAM Workshop
<BR>Adobe Photoshop
<BR>NSIS

<H3><A name="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</A></H3>
<P>Q: Do I have to start a new game?</P>

<P>A: No. There is one prologue encounter that may be missed if you use an existing game, but Finch and her quest are available without starting a new game. You may also notice a few weird things if you use a savegame from a pre-v2 Finch install after you've updated to v2 or later.</P>

<P>Q: Help! Finch talked to me in Candlekeep, then left!</P>

<P>A: This is perfectly normal. Finch is not party-joinable until you meet up with her again in Beregost.</P>

<P>Q: Help! I want Finch in my party! Where do I find her in Beregost?</P>

<P>A: In the Red Sheaf Inn.</P>

<P>Q: I'm sick of looking for those damn books Finch needs for her quest. Where are they already?</P>

<P>A: You can find the six books needed for the library at the Bandit Camp (FW1900), Gullykin (FW4002), Pedvale (FW2400), the Carnival outside Nashkel (FW4900) and the Cloakwood Mines (FW1803). Finch has the sixth book already on her person when you meet her in Beregost.</P>

<P>Q: I've found lots of books. How do I know which ones are for Finch's quest?</P>

<P>A: Finch will tell you.</P>

<P>Q: Finch told me we found all the books for the library. What do I do with them?</P>

<P>A: Take them to Nashkel Manor (FW4804) and speak with Trask.</P>

<P>Q: Ruh-roh. I just made those snobs at Nashkel Manor mad, and now Finch has stomped off in a huff! How do I get her back?</P>

<P>A: Wait for Finch SoA? No, really, you can ignore Finch's quest as long as you like without her getting pesky, but if your actions ruin her chances of setting up the library at Nashkel Manor, she'll leave the party FOREVAARRRR. Be more careful what you say or do to the residents next time.</P>

<P>Q: What about Mur'Neth and Indira? Will Finch banter with them?</P>

<P>A: If they are installed, yes, because they are very cool original NPCs.</P>

<P>Q: Is Tales of the Sword Coast required to play with Finch?</P>

<P>A: With version 3 and later, TotSC should not be required to install Finch or complete her quest. If you are playing a version prior to v3, see the Tutu discussion forums on PPG for workarounds.</P>

<H3><A name="HISTORY">Version History</A></H3>

<P>30/03/21 - Version 5.0 by tipun and jastey: EET compatibility added: Added check when installing GAME_IS ~tutu tutu_totsc bgee bgt eet~ instead of the one that was before; Depending on the type of game, links to banter files are added either to Interdia.2da or BGBANTER.2DA, and links to scripts and dialogs (POST) are added either to PDialog.2da or BGDIALOG.2da; Added the removal of NPCs after the end of the introductory SoD; Added EET_NPC_TRANSITION (tipun). Changed dlg names to EET name convention (jastey). Added more checks to banters so they will only fire when all NPCs are in oarty and can talk. Corrected Banter dlg names for BGT. Added finchnpc.ini with mod metadata to support Project Infinity. Updated readme.</P>

<P>Version 4.0 by Erg: added BG:EE and BGT compatibility. Added Dream Timer to prevent dream banters (i.e. the coversations that are scripted to occur when the party rests) from firing all at once; Finch borrows, with permission, the Dream Timer code and variables from BG1 NPC Project, like Gavin and other mods designed to work with BG1 NPC Project. Fixed order of banters to prevent normal banters from firing at rest and replace dream banters. Fixed one of the banters with Minsc (now it fires only after Dynaheir has been rescued, as it should). Fixed double reward exploit in Firebead's Quest in Beregost when other mods altering Firebead dialogue, like for example BG1 NPC Project, are also installed. Replaced AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT with the more up to date README as command to display the ReadMe (suggested by Isaya). Corrected subtitles mismatch for one of Finch phrases (thanks to Sylvus_Moonbow for reporting the mismatch). Moved some strings from .tp2 to .tra files. French traslation kindly revised and updated by Isaya. Added German translation (kindly provided by Leonardo Watson). Replaced all STATE_SLEEPING with the more reliable CD_STATE_NOTVALID. </P>

<P>7/30/06 - Version 3.0 released - Spanish translation added. Conditions mistake in one Khalid banter corrected. Lord Foreshadow interjection removed for compatability with BG1NPC ring-giving. AR2600 extend changed from EXTEND_TOP to EXTEND_BOTTOM so as to not interfere with prologue-narrative goodness. Split known TotSC interjections to a separate d file, and added checks to see that TotSC files are in Tutu conversion before trying to install. Moved book previously found in Durlag's Tower to non-TotSC area. Added two more books to quest supplies since, as complained, four books is a hiccup-sized library. Added a few more PC-init interactions.

<P>11/07/05 - Version 2.0 released - Finch's Identify ability now works like the Glasses of Identification, so innate ability is removed thanks to Sim. Removed extra first level spell slots on level 1 and 2 CREs. Changed scripting of prologue Finch meeting to be compatible with Tutu journal fix. Changed scripting of Finch spawning so that she's not missing for players who have already visited the Red Sheaf Inn. Corrected four typos thanks to T, Necaradan, and Creepin. Found another 22 typos (gah!) upon new readthrough. Improved Karlat encounter scripting at the Red Sheaf Inn. Added Indira and Mur'Neth banter. Added 40+ interjections. Added French translation.</P>

<P>3/10/05 - Version 1.2 released - Added Finch's innate ability to CREs, rather than adding upon creation. Fixed two bugs thanks to shamrock_uk: Horrible Finch quest-talking loops fixed, and Finch's bookbag is no longer marked quest critical and left with the party upon death or departure. (I don't know how that box got checked! Honest!)</P>

<P>3/6/05 - Version 1.1 released - corrected 3 typos, added new Trask dialogue.</P>

<P>3/5/05 - Version 1 released.</P>
